## Bootstrap Layouts

##### React-Bootstrap is a library of reuseable front-end components. You'll get the look-and-feel of Twitter Bootstrap, but with much cleaner code, via Facebook's React.js framework.

---

This project includes all *official* React-Bootstrap Components with original options sets.

Every component has its own description which is accessible at Component Property -> ReadMe
